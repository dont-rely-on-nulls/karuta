* About
This is a toy general purpose relational programming language. We are not held accountable for anything that
might happen if you are crazy enough to use it.

* Requirements

** Prolog
- [X] PL Parsing
- [X] PL Register Allocation  
- [X] PL Compilation
- [X] PL Evaluation
- [X] PL Integer Literals  
- [ ] PL List Literals  
- [ ] PL Query Conjuction  
- [X] Comments
- [ ] Namespacing
- [ ] Special syntax for database support using ~@~
- [ ] Dedicated bytecode for database interaction
- [ ] Serialization for relational engine protocol
- [ ] Some sort of type checking (if provided a .krt file with the types)
     - If you provide a file with the types, use that
     - If not, you can pass a flag to skip the check
     - If another flag is provided, you impure the compiler to ask the relational engine
     - If nothing above, fuck you. I will fail.

** Database Integration  
- [ ] Introduce relational builtins (~nat~, ~int~, ~plus~, ~multiply~).
- [ ] Define a protocol for the language runtime to interact with.
- [ ] Introduce support for querying multiple values (~[10..20]~ example).
