* About
This is a toy, general-purpose relational programming language. We are not held accountable for anything that
might happen if you are crazy enough to use it.

* Requirements

** Prolog
- [X] PL Parsing
- [X] PL Register Allocation
- [X] PL Query Conjunction
- [X] Comments
- [ ] BEAM runtime library (logic variables, backtracking)
- [ ] PL Compilation
- [ ] PL Integer Literals
- [ ] PL List Literals
- [ ] Implement toolchain (i.e. compile to BEAM assembly, call ~erlc~ on that)
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Special syntax for database support using ~@~
- [ ] Dedicated bytecode for database interaction
- [ ] Some sort of type checking (if provided a .krt file with the types)
     - If you provide a file with the types, use that
     - If not, you can pass a flag to skip the check
     - If another flag is provided, you impure the compiler to ask the relational engine
     - If nothing above, fuck you. I will fail.
- [ ] Compiler generates literals for queries with numbers

** Domino
- [ ] Introduce relational builtins (~nat~, ~int~, ~plus~, ~multiply~).
- [ ] Define a protocol for the language runtime to interact with.
- [ ] Introduce support for querying multiple values (~[10..20]~ example).
